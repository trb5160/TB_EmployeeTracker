Tom Barber - Employee Tracker

Description: In the workplace, managers can find themselves being responsible for a lot of people, and teams can grow to levels where it can be hard to keep track
of who is working where and who is under who.  To combat this problem, I designed an app that allows employers to create a table of their employees complete with 
various pieces of information about them, such as what department they're in, what their role on the team is, and who their manager is.  The app is connected to a mysql database and uses the information there to populate the table.  In the app, the information can be updated or even new information added as the employer wishes.
